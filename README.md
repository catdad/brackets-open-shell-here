## Windows

Supported shells include the default CMD, PowerShell, and on Windows 10, when enabled, bash is supported as well.

## Linux and macOS

There are other extensions already that have pretty robust Linux support. I did not find one for Windows (an OS I use regularly), and so I made one. I plan on adding [Linux](https://github.com/catdad/brackets-open-shell-here/issues/1) and [macOS](https://github.com/catdad/brackets-open-shell-here/issues/2) support as I get time. For now, this module will do nothing on those operating systems.

## Building the extension

```bash
gulp
```

This will create the requires zip file in the `output` folder.
